# AI Health Assistant: Multi-channel symptom analysis & voice support

## Overview

AI Health Assistant is a comprehensive, multi-channel platform designed to provide accessible preliminary health insights. It leverages the power of IBM Watsonx and generative AI to analyze symptoms, offer home remedies, and provide guidance in real-time.

Uniquely, it offers a seamless **voice-first experience** on the web and extends its reach to millions of users via a fully integrated **WhatsApp bot**, ensuring healthcare guidance is available wherever the user is.

## Problem Statement

Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker helps users understand their health conditions by analyzing symptoms and providing probable causes, preventive advice, and care recommendations. It retrieves verified medical data, symptom databases, and guidelines from trusted sources like WHO, government health portals, and medical journals. Users can input symptoms in natural language such as “I have a sore throat and fever,” and the agent provides possible conditions, urgency level, home remedies, and when to consult a doctor. It supports multi-language interaction and avoids self-diagnosis risks by offering educational and referral-based suggestions. This AI-driven assistant promotes early detection, reduces misinformation, and empowers users to take informed health actions.
