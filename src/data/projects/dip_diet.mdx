# DIP Diet Agent: Your one and only platform for healthy life

## Overview

Dip Diet Agent is an AI-powered wellness assistant built on IBM Cloud and watsonx.ai, designed to deliver personalized, context-aware diet recommendations. By combining scientific nutrition data, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and intelligent reasoning, it empowers users to make informed health and dietary choices with ease.

## Why We Built This

We created **Dip Diet Agent** to solve a real-world challenge — the abundance of **generic, unreliable diet advice** online.  

While exploring nutrition and AI systems, we observed that most chat-based assistants lacked **factual grounding**, **context awareness**, and **personalization**.  
Our goal was to build a **trusted, science-backed AI diet companion** that merges verified nutritional data with **IBM Cloud’s scalable infrastructure** and **watsonx.ai’s powerful models**, enabling users to achieve sustainable wellness through intelligent guidance.
