# CHD Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on the early prediction of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing clinical parameters, the model assesses the risk level for patients, aiding in preventative healthcare.

## Technical Details
- **Preprocessing**: Robust data cleaning and normalization pipelines.
- **Modeling**: Utilizes classification algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- **Evaluation**: Optimized for high recall to ensure potential cases are not missed.
- **Deployment**: Exposes a prediction API for integration with healthcare systems.
