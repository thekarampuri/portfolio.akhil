# CrowdVision AI

## Overview
CrowdVision AI is a comprehensive surveillance ecosystem designed to enhance public safety. It combines computer vision, geospatial mapping, and real-time alerting to transform standard CCTV feeds into actionable intelligence.

## Architecture
1.  **Central Command Dashboard**: A Next.js-based web dashboard for monitoring live feeds and heatmaps.
2.  **ML Inference Server**: Python Flask server running YOLOv8 for person detection and crowd density analysis.
3.  **Field Officer App**: Android application for ground personnel to receive real-time location-based alerts.

## Key Features
- **Crowd Density Estimation**: Real-time analysis of crowd levels.
- **Geospatial Heatmaps**: Visualizing high-density areas on map layers.
- **Instant Alerts**: Push notifications to field officers based on risk thresholds.
