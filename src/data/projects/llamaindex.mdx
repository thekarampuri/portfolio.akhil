# Cybersecurity AI Mentor: Learn Security with AI + RAG

## Overview

Cybersecurity AI Mentor is a full-stack learning assistant that helps users master cybersecurity concepts through interactive chat, document-grounded answers, and adaptive explanations.  
It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure every answer is based on trusted sources like NIST and OWASP, not just generic LLM output.

## Why I Built This

Learning cybersecurity is tough—resources are scattered, and generic AI answers can be unreliable.  
I built this project to:
- Provide a single, interactive place to learn and ask questions,
- Guarantee answers are grounded in real security docs,
- Make it easy to deploy and scale with Docker and cloud platforms.

## Key Features

- **AI Chat Tutor with RAG**: Answers are always sourced from curated security documents (OWASP, NIST, etc.).
- **Adaptive Explanations**: User can select beginner, intermediate, or expert mode for tailored responses.
- **Streaming UI**: Fast, real-time chat experience with Chainlit.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Deployable to Hugging Face Spaces, Render, GCP, or DigitalOcean with Docker.
- **Custom Branding**: Supports custom logos, avatars, and UI theming.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI**: Chainlit (Python, React-based)
- **Backend/AI**: LlamaIndex (RAG), Groq LLM API
- **Deployment**: Docker, Hugging Face Spaces
- **Docs**: NIST, OWASP, and custom lab content

## Future Plans

- Add user authentication and progress tracking
- Expand document set and add scenario-based labs
- Integrate more LLM providers and advanced RAG features
