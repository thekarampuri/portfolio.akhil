# GradeU: Learn cybersecurity with AI + proctored assessments

## Overview

GradeU is a full-stack cybersecurity learning platform designed to help learners build real skills through structured content, adaptive guidance, and secure assessments.  
It combines an AI tutor powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a proctored testing experience, so learning stays practical, measurable, and trustworthy.

## Why We Built This

GradeU learners often face two problems:
1) content that’s scattered and hard to follow, and  
2) assessments that don’t reliably validate real understanding.

We built **GradeU** to deliver a single experience where users can:
- learn in a structured way,
- ask questions with answers grounded in credible sources,
- and validate skills through proctored assessments that reduce cheating.

## Key Features

- **AI Tutor with RAG**: Answers grounded in curated security references (e.g., OWASP, NIST-style documents) instead of generic responses.
- **Proctored Assessments**: Camera/microphone-enabled monitoring with basic exam integrity controls.
- **Adaptive Learning Path**: Learner progression informs recommendations and next steps.
- **Practice + Progress Tracking**: Track completion, performance, and skill level across modules.
- **Career Support**: Job-focused learning signals and student tooling aligned with outcomes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- **Database/Auth**: Supabase
- **AI Layer**: RAG over security documents + LLM (Gemini)
- **Media/Proctoring**: Browser media APIs for webcam/mic permissions and monitoring workflow

## Future Plans

- Add deeper analytics for learner strengths and weaknesses
- Expand question banks and scenario-based labs
- Our own CMD
